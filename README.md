## VISION version 1

When we organize a party at home a big issue we are facing is setting the right music. Usually we choose only one type of music for the entire house, so the big question is, will everyone be satisfied? A smart multi-room system comes to answer this question.
Split your house into multiple party rooms, each playing a different style of music by interacting with the guests, so that there is a democratic approach to the music selection. Upon arrival, in order to ease the initial choice of the room, the guests are invited to select their preferred music taste so that the system can determine the profile of the user. After the profile compiling the system will assign and display a color to each music type, so the user will recognize which room to enter by the matching color of the room's lights and the color of each music type. After entering the correct room, a new voting system will be available among the guests as to what song they would like to be played next from a predefined, but large, playlist. The guests after leaving the party will have complete access to the party's playlist which will be provided by the host, so that they can find the songs they enjoyed the most and listen to them again.
