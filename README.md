## VISION

When we organize a party at our house we usually choose only one type of music for the entire house, but will everyone be satisfied? A smart multi-room system comes to answer this question by splitting the house into multiple party rooms, each playing a different style of music so that there is a democratic approach to the music selection. 
Upon arrival the guests are invited to select their preferred music taste. Then a color will be assigned to each type of music, so the user will recognize which room to enter by matching the colors of the music type and the room's lights. After entering the correct room, guests can vote what song they would like to be played next from a predefined, but large, playlist. After leaving the party they will have complete access to the party's playlist which will be provided by the host.
